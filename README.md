Secret Santa App

(Ok, it's not so secret because you can see other names on the list, I've kept 
the code as simple as possible, but go ahead and fork it if you wish to add a 
login or something else)

The main purpose of the app is to have a list of names that you pull out of 
a hat (like when you do the secret Santa dynamic at the office).

I've added comments to the js file explaining what everything does.

Check demo at https://virtuodigital.github.io/secret-santa/

(The demo will not save the names to JSON but gives you an idea of how it works)

Please report bugs, fix, collaborate, fork away and have fun!
